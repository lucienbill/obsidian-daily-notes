# Obsidian Daily Notes
## What's that thing for (description)?
There are a few questions my brain struggles to answer:
- What have I done yesterday? And last week? Last month?
- Where did I stop yesterday? What was my plan?

Thankfully I take notes: there are the persistent memory that I don't naturally have.
For years I wrote things in a mostly unordered fashion in many unsaved tabs in NotePad++.
While better than nothing, it has its limitations.

I recently discovered [this article](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/writing-down-what-i-do-in-obsidian/) by Chris Krycho: " Writing Down What I Doâ€”In Obsidian".

This repository is my own version of his system:
- The structure is looser (simpler for me to leverage)
- It makes use of the Templater plugin to automate some naming and links
